# Quora_similar_classification
The project explicates the semantic similarity between sentences using the Quora dataset. It defines whether two quora answers are similar are not. Feature engineering is the one only step needed for the dataset.To make the model more effective more no. of features are formed to train.The length,length difference,char wise length,word length and common words are basic feature engg tricks. Fuzzy logic basically converts the class from 0 and 1 TO 0 to 1 i.e it answer need not be definite no or definite yes it can be ok,maybe etc.This leads to fuzzy features in NLP the ratio in the program defines how much are the two strings are similar to each other. Word_2_Vec model is a two layer neural network which converts words to vector and word with similar meaning are close to each other the distance between the vectors is less. I have used gensim pretrained model to get vectors for for particular model.You just need to pip install it and simply use model['word'] to get vector the problem here is sentences. The sent2vec code snippet converts the all the words in a sentence into vectors and returns a normalized vector for each sentence. Jaccards distance,cosine distance are similarity parameters for the vectors.Fit transform the values to normalize it then divide it in train and validation set and train the logistic regression model.
